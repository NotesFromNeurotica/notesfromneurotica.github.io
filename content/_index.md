*As a foreword, I give a warning to those who do not wish to read on the topics of general anxiety, self-hate, narcissism, and dysmorphic and shaming attitudes that this website may not be the place for you, as they will be heavily covered through the writing on this page.*

This page serves as an archive of my notes. The confines of this website are things which I believe I live, things that consume me tirelessly, which it has done in excess for years. The thoughts that neurotically leech on my brain with no escape. I do not speak of it often, and in the past I have found it relatively embarrassing, emasculating, and as a redundant knowledge to others. Weakness and emotional distress are not virtues, after all. I do not see myself as a particularly good writer, orator, or poet, but I can write from lived experience. I have not found it a simple state of mind to write on, or even speak of, but I have had it planned for quite some time and settled that now is the right time to do so. 

In an abstract manner, this website is a stage for my lone confessional. A confessional of the cerebral sins, the pain-ridden regrets, and the unheard cries. I have tried to write the posts with many personal feelings attached, but have extended a selection of universality to the texts for the reader. I write this with an open arm, intending to share my thoughts on a sickness of fear and anxiety which cripples, something which the reader will hopefully relate to. In a number of years, I wish to look back on this writing as a distant memory, not a stark feeling of repetition. Thanks for taking a look.

Also, I do not have the ability to allow for comments on this page at the moment *(Beyond my technical expertise for a side project)*, here is **[my Twitter](https://twitter.com/IoannesNotes)** for messages or inquiries.
